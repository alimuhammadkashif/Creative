An organization chart or org chart is a diagram that shows the hierarchical structure of an organization. Usually a chart starts with a higher or superior level and branches downward to subordinate levels.

An organizational chart of a company usually shows the managers and sub-workers who make up an organization. It also shows the relationships between the organization's staff members. Such charts are helpful to show a new employee where he fits in the organization.

In many large companies the organization chart can be large and incredibly complicated and is therefore sometimes dissected into smaller charts for each individual department within the organization. RFFlow allows you to add hyperlinks so you can click on a shape and jump to another chart.</p>
